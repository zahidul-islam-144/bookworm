## About this project
### This is basically a educational site where student can see others Q/A and teacher's feedback in comment section though some features is not designed yet. It will be done later. I just build a interface of my project idea. Teacher can posts about any topic for students, can write blog and anyone can work here as a mentor. Here, students can learn by themselves watching our tutorials.
